# Tumor Classification iOS App with Swift, Core ML Integration, and Python Model Training

## Project Overview

This project aims to develop an **AI-powered skin disease classification system** that can detect multiple types of skin conditions from medical images. The model is trained using **deep learning techniques with cross-validation** to enhance robustness and generalization.

The system supports classification of the following disease categories:

- **MEL**: Melanoma
- **NV**: Melanocytic Nevi
- **BCC**: Basal Cell Carcinoma
- **AK**: Actinic Keratoses
- **BKL**: Benign Keratosis-like Lesions  
- **DF**: Dermatofibroma
- **VASC**: Vascular Lesions
- **SCC**: Squamous Cell Carcinoma

The trained model is deployed on a **backend server**, which receives input images from the iOS application and returns classification results via API. This architecture allows for scalable inference, easier model updates, and smooth mobile integration.

Our goal is to provide a **fast, reliable, and accessible tool** to help users and healthcare professionals identify potential skin abnormalities across a wide range of conditions.
