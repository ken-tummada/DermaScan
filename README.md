# Tumor Classification iOS App with Swift, Core ML Integration, and Python Model Training

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop an **AI-powered tumor classification system** that can detect **malignant (cancerous) and benign (non-cancerous) skin tumors** from medical images. The machine learning model is trained using **deep learning (CNNs)** and deployed directly into an iOS application via **Appleâ€™s Core ML framework**.

Our goal is to provide a **fast, reliable, and offline tumor classification tool** that can assist medical professionals and users in identifying potential skin abnormalities.
