Eczema,Eczema,BC997C,"Eczema, or atopic dermatitis, is a chronic inflammatory skin condition causing redness, itching, dryness, and irritation. It often appears in childhood and can persist into adulthood. The skin becomes sensitive and prone to flare-ups, sometimes leading to cracking or infections due to excessive scratching.","Eczema is linked to an overactive immune response, genetic predisposition, and environmental triggers like allergens, stress, or irritants. A weakened skin barrier allows moisture loss and irritants to penetrate, worsening symptoms. Weather changes, certain fabrics, and harsh soaps can also provoke flare-ups.","Infants, children, and adults with a family history of allergies, asthma, or hay fever.","Physical examination, patch testing for allergens, and skin biopsy in rare cases."
Melanoma,Melanoma,BC997C,"Melanoma is an aggressive skin cancer that originates in melanocytes, the cells responsible for producing skin pigment. It often appears as an irregular mole with uneven color and rapid growth. If untreated, it can spread to other organs, making early detection and treatment crucial for survival.","Excessive ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure from sunlight or tanning beds is the leading cause. Genetic factors, a history of sunburns, and fair skin increase the risk. Some melanomas develop in non-sun-exposed areas, suggesting internal genetic triggers.","Individuals with fair skin, excessive sun exposure, or a family history of melanoma.","Dermoscopic examination, skin biopsy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and imaging tests like CT or MRI."
Atopic Dermatitis,Atopic Dermatitis,BC997C,"Atopic dermatitis is a chronic skin disorder characterized by persistent itching, redness, and dry, scaly patches. It is common in children and often linked to allergic conditions like asthma. Severe cases may cause thickened skin due to constant scratching, increasing susceptibility to secondary infections.","This condition results from a combination of genetic, immune, and environmental factors. An overactive immune system reacts to irritants like dust mites, pet dander, or soaps. Cold weather, stress, and certain fabrics can worsen symptoms by disrupting the skin__ protective barrier.","Infants and young children, individuals with a family history of allergies, asthma, or eczema.","Physical examination, allergy testing, and skin biopsy in severe cases."
Basal Cell Carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma,BC997C,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer, arising from the basal cells of the epidermis. It typically appears as a pearly or waxy bump, a flat scar-like lesion, or an open sore that does not heal. BCC rarely spreads to other organs but can cause local tissue damage if untreated.","Chronic sun exposure is the primary cause of BCC, particularly in fair-skinned individuals. Other risk factors include frequent sunburns, aging, exposure to radiation or chemicals, and genetic predisposition. Using sunscreen and protective clothing can help reduce risk.","Older adults, individuals with fair skin, and those with excessive sun exposure.","Skin biopsy, dermoscopic examination, and imaging tests for advanced cases."
Melanocytic Nevi,Melanocytic Nevi,BC997C,"Melanocytic nevi, commonly called moles, are benign growths composed of pigment-producing cells. They can be present at birth or develop later in life. While most moles remain harmless, some can change in size, shape, or color, requiring medical evaluation to rule out malignancy.","Moles form due to genetic factors and sun exposure, which stimulates melanocyte activity. Hormonal changes during puberty and pregnancy may also influence their development. Individuals with numerous or atypical moles may have an increased risk of melanoma.","People of all ages, particularly those with fair skin or a genetic predisposition.","Dermoscopic evaluation, biopsy if atypical features are present."
Benign Keratosis,Benign Keratosis,BC997C,"Benign keratosis refers to a group of non-cancerous skin growths that develop due to excess keratin production. These lesions may appear as rough, scaly, or warty patches, commonly on sun-exposed areas. While harmless, they can sometimes resemble precancerous lesions, requiring medical evaluation if changes occur.","The main causes include prolonged sun exposure, genetic predisposition, and aging. Chronic skin irritation, environmental pollutants, and repeated friction may also contribute to the formation of benign keratoses. They are more common in fair-skinned individuals.","Older adults, individuals with fair skin, and people with a history of excessive sun exposure.","Physical examination, dermoscopy, and biopsy if malignancy is suspected."
Psoriasis,Psoriasis,BC997C,"Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that causes the rapid overproduction of skin cells, leading to thick, scaly patches. It commonly affects the scalp, elbows, knees, and lower back. The condition is chronic, with periods of flare-ups and remission. Severe cases may also involve joint inflammation, known as psoriatic arthritis.","An overactive immune system triggers inflammation, causing excessive skin cell production. Genetic predisposition is a key factor, and external triggers like infections, stress, cold weather, and certain medications can worsen symptoms. Lifestyle modifications can help manage flare-ups.","Adults with a family history of psoriasis, individuals with autoimmune diseases.","Physical examination, skin biopsy, and blood tests to rule out other conditions."
Seborrheic Keratoses,Seborrheic Keratoses,BC997C,"Seborrheic keratoses are common, benign skin growths that appear as waxy, scaly, or wart-like lesions. They typically develop on the face, chest, shoulders, or back. Although they can resemble melanoma, they are non-cancerous and do not require removal unless irritated or for cosmetic reasons.","Aging and genetic predisposition are the primary factors. Sun exposure may play a role, as these lesions often appear in sun-exposed areas. Hormonal changes and certain skin types also increase the likelihood of developing seborrheic keratoses.","Middle-aged and older adults, individuals with a family history of seborrheic keratoses.","Clinical examination, dermoscopy, and biopsy if the lesion appears irregular."
Tinea Ringworm,Tinea Ringworm,BC997C,"Tinea, commonly known as ringworm, is a fungal infection of the skin that causes circular, scaly, and itchy rashes. Despite its name, it is not caused by a worm but by dermatophyte fungi. It can affect various body parts, including the scalp, feet, groin, and torso, and spreads easily through direct contact.","Tinea infections are caused by dermatophyte fungi such as Trichophyton and Microsporum. These fungi thrive in warm, moist environments and spread through skin-to-skin contact, shared personal items, or contaminated surfaces like gym floors and locker rooms.","Children, athletes, individuals with weakened immune systems, and people who wear tight or damp clothing for prolonged periods.","Clinical examination, Wood__ lamp test, fungal culture, and skin scrapings for microscopic analysis."
Warts,Warts,BC997C,"Warts are small, rough, skin growths caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). They can appear on the hands, feet, face, and genitals. While usually harmless, they can be persistent and sometimes painful. Some types, such as genital warts, are linked to specific HPV strains with a risk of complications.",Warts develop when the HPV virus enters the skin through small cuts or abrasions. They are highly contagious and spread through direct contact or touching contaminated surfaces. People with weakened immune systems are more susceptible to persistent warts.,"Children, teenagers, individuals with weakened immune systems, and people frequently exposed to public showers or pools.","Physical examination, dermoscopy, and biopsy in atypical or persistent cases."
