Actinic Keratosis,Actinic Keratosis,A88668,"Actinic keratoses are rough, scaly spots or patches that form on the surface of the skin. They often have a dry or crusty texture and may feel sensitive or tender to the touch. The affected areas can vary in color, appearing red, pink, or brown, and may become thicker or raised over time. These skin changes are usually small but can slowly enlarge and sometimes appear in clusters. Regular observation and appropriate skin care are important to manage the condition.","Prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun or artificial sources like tanning beds is a major contributing factor. Repeated sun damage over time can lead to changes in skin cells. Other factors may include a history of frequent sunburns, lack of adequate sun protection, and cumulative environmental exposure. Skin type and long-term outdoor activity may also increase risk.","This condition is more commonly seen in adults with frequent outdoor lifestyles. It often affects people with lighter skin tones, especially those living in sunny regions. Individuals who have spent years working or spending time outdoors without consistent skin protection may be more likely to develop it.","Visual inspection, dermoscopic examination, and skin biopsy if lesions appear atypical or fail to respond to treatment."
Basal Cell Carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma,D3AA93,"Basal cell carcinoma is a type of skin growth that often appears as a small, shiny bump or nodule on the skin. It may also show as a flat, scaly patch or a sore that doesn’t heal. The affected area can become raised, crusted, or develop visible blood vessels. Over time, the growth may slowly expand and change in appearance, sometimes forming a central indentation or ulcer. Careful monitoring and skin care are recommended for managing the condition.","Long-term ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure is a primary cause, especially when the skin is not protected. Environmental factors such as sunburns, outdoor work, or recreational habits may contribute. Use of tanning beds and exposure to certain chemical substances can also play a role. Skin injuries that do not heal properly may be linked to development in some cases.","It is most frequently found in older adults, particularly those who have spent a significant amount of time outdoors. People with fair skin, light-colored eyes, or a history of skin sensitivity to sunlight are more likely to experience it. It is also more common in geographic areas with high sun exposure.","Skin examination, dermoscopy, and skin biopsy to confirm diagnosis. Imaging tests may be used in advanced or recurrent cases."
Benign Keratosis,Benign Keratosis,B38975,"Benign keratosis refers to non-cancerous skin growths that may appear as raised, rough, or wart-like spots. These growths can vary in color, including brown, black, or tan, and often have a waxy or stuck-on look. They may appear singly or in groups, and their surface might feel dry or uneven. Though harmless, they can change slowly over time in size or texture. Monitoring for any noticeable changes is helpful in managing the condition.","Skin aging is considered a major factor, often leading to the gradual development of surface changes over time. External influences such as sun exposure, environmental stressors, or skin friction may contribute. A family history of similar growths can increase likelihood. Some cases appear without a clear external cause, suggesting a role for individual skin biology.","This skin condition is commonly observed in middle-aged and older adults. It is more frequent among individuals with fair skin, although it can occur in all skin types. The appearance tends to increase with age, and it is often noticed in those with a history of various skin changes over time.",Clinical evaluation and dermoscopy are typically sufficient. A biopsy may be performed if the appearance is uncertain or changes.
Dermatofibroma,Dermatofibroma,D4B6A4,"Dermatofibroma is a firm, small skin nodule that typically feels like a hard bump beneath the surface. It is usually round or oval, with a surface that may appear smooth, slightly scaly, or darker than the surrounding skin. The bump often remains stable in size and shape, but can sometimes be tender or itchy when touched. It usually forms on the legs, arms, or shoulders and may become more noticeable over time. Regular observation is recommended.","Minor skin trauma such as insect bites, shaving cuts, or other small injuries may contribute to the development of these nodules. In some cases, they arise at the site of past irritation or inflammation. The body’s healing response may cause a buildup of fibrous tissue. While the exact cause is not always known, localized skin reactions appear to be a factor.","It is more frequently reported in adults, especially women. While it can appear at any age, it is rarely seen in children. Individuals who have experienced frequent minor skin irritations or injuries may be more likely to notice its development over time, although it may occur without clear reasons.",Diagnosis is often made through clinical examination and dermoscopy. Biopsy may be done if the lesion has unusual features.
Melanocytic Nevus,Melanocytic Nevus,CAA69E,"Melanocytic nevus is a common skin mark, often referred to as a mole. It usually appears as a round or oval spot with a uniform color such as brown, black, or tan. The surface may be flat or slightly raised, and the texture can range from smooth to slightly rough. Most are small and stable in size, though some may slowly change in appearance over time. Moles can occur anywhere on the skin and are typically harmless but may need regular observation.","Genetic factors play a central role, often determining how many moles a person has and how they develop. Exposure to sunlight, especially during early years, can also influence appearance over time. Hormonal changes during adolescence or pregnancy may lead to changes in size or color. Some moles appear spontaneously without any clear environmental trigger.","This condition is widespread across all age groups but often begins in childhood or adolescence. It can appear in people of all skin types and ethnic backgrounds. The number and appearance may change during different life stages, including puberty and pregnancy, and is very common overall.","Regular skin checks, dermoscopy to evaluate color and border, and biopsy if significant changes in size, shape, or color occur."
Melanoma,Melanoma,BB9984,"Melanoma is a type of skin growth that may appear as a new dark spot or a change in an existing mole. It can have uneven borders, varied colors, or an unusual shape. The surface might be flat or raised and may sometimes itch, bleed, or change over time. These changes can occur on any part of the skin, including areas not commonly exposed. Careful attention to skin appearance is important for identifying and managing this condition.","DNA damage in skin cells from ultraviolet (UV) light is a major factor, especially when sun protection is inconsistent. Intermittent intense sun exposure and history of sunburns are linked with higher risk. Tanning bed use may also increase susceptibility. Genetic mutations and a family history may contribute, and some cases arise in areas with no obvious exposure.",Melanoma may occur in people of any age but is more commonly seen in adults. It is more frequently diagnosed in those with lighter skin tones and people who have numerous or atypical moles. Individuals with a personal or family history of skin conditions may be more likely to be affected.,"Dermoscopy, skin biopsy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and imaging tests like CT, MRI, or PET scan to assess spread and staging."
Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Squamous Cell Carcinoma,A27967,"Squamous cell carcinoma is a skin condition that often appears as a firm, red bump or a flat lesion with a scaly, crusted surface. It may also present as a sore that heals and reopens repeatedly. Over time, the affected area can become raised, thickened, or rough to the touch. These changes usually occur on exposed areas of the skin and may gradually grow in size. Regular monitoring helps in recognizing any changes in the lesion’s appearance.","Chronic exposure to ultraviolet (UV) rays is a leading factor, especially in areas frequently exposed to sunlight. Skin damage from burns, radiation, or long-term inflammation may also contribute. Chemical exposure and immune system conditions can play a role in some cases. Scar tissue or previously injured skin may be more susceptible to changes.","This condition is more common in older adults, particularly those with fair skin. People who have spent extended time outdoors or live in areas with strong sunlight may be more affected. It is also more frequently observed in individuals with past skin injuries or long-term skin changes.","Skin examination, dermoscopy, and biopsy for confirmation. Imaging may be considered if deeper tissue involvement is suspected."
Vascular Lesion,Vascular Lesion,B37759,"Vascular lesion refers to an area of the skin where blood vessels are visibly clustered or altered. These lesions may appear as red, purple, or blue spots, patches, or raised growths. The shape and size can vary, and the surface might be smooth or slightly textured. Some lesions are soft to the touch, while others may feel firmer. They can be stable over time or slowly change in appearance. Visual observation is important for tracking any developments.","Vascular lesions may arise from abnormalities in blood vessel formation or function. Some are present from birth, while others develop later due to hormonal changes, injury, or unknown triggers. Pressure, friction, or repeated irritation may influence development in certain areas. Genetic factors may also play a role in how these lesions form and appear.","These lesions can occur at any age, though some types are more frequently noticed in infancy or early childhood. Others may appear later in adulthood. They affect people across all skin types, and certain variations are more often observed in females than males, though both can be affected.","Clinical evaluation and visual assessment. In some cases, ultrasound or MRI may be used to assess depth or vascular involvement."
