Actinic Keratosis,Actinic Keratosis,A88668,"Actinic keratosis is a rough, scaly patch that forms on sun-exposed areas of the skin due to long-term UV radiation. It is considered precancerous and can progress to squamous cell carcinoma if untreated.","Actinic keratosis is primarily caused by long-term exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight or tanning beds. UV radiation damages the DNA in skin cells, leading to abnormal growth and precancerous changes over time.","Primarily affects older adults, particularly those with fair skin and a history of prolonged sun exposure. People living in sunny climates or engaging in outdoor activities are at higher risk. ","Visual inspection, dermoscopic examination, and skin biopsy if lesions appear atypical or fail to respond to treatment."
Basal Cell Carcinoma,Basal Cell Carcinoma,D3AA93,"Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It develops in the basal cells of the epidermis, typically appearing as a pearly bump or flat lesion. It rarely spreads but can cause significant local damage.","Basal cell carcinoma develops mainly due to chronic UV radiation exposure, causing mutations in the DNA of basal cells. Other factors include fair skin, use of tanning beds, radiation therapy, and immune suppression conditions.","Most commonly seen in individuals over 50 years old with fair skin, light-colored eyes, and a history of frequent sunburns or chronic sun exposure. Outdoor workers and residents of sunny regions are especially susceptible.","Skin examination, dermoscopy, and skin biopsy to confirm diagnosis. Imaging tests may be used in advanced or recurrent cases."
Benign Keratosis,Benign Keratosis,B38975,"Benign keratosis refers to a group of noncancerous skin lesions, such as seborrheic keratoses and solar lentigines. These lesions often appear as waxy, scaly, or wart-like growths, usually in older adults after sun exposure.","Benign keratosis lesions, such as seborrheic keratoses, are associated with aging, genetic predisposition, and cumulative sun exposure. The exact cause remains unclear, but ultraviolet radiation may contribute to lesion development. ","Typically occurs in middle-aged and older adults. Individuals with lighter skin tones are more likely to develop benign keratoses, particularly with increased cumulative sun exposure over time. ",Clinical evaluation and dermoscopy are typically sufficient. A biopsy may be performed if the appearance is uncertain or changes.
Dermatofibroma,Dermatofibroma,D4B6A4,"Dermatofibroma is a common benign skin nodule composed of fibrous tissue. It often develops on the legs and appears as a firm, raised bump that may vary in color. It is harmless and usually does not require medical treatment.","Dermatofibroma is believed to be a reaction to minor skin trauma, such as insect bites, shaving injuries, or thorn pricks. The exact cause is unknown, but an exaggerated healing response leads to the growth of fibrous tissue under the skin.","More frequently found in adults, especially women between the ages of 20 and 50. Lesions are often located on the lower legs but can occur anywhere on the body after minor skin injuries.",Diagnosis is often made through clinical examination and dermoscopy. Biopsy may be done if the lesion has unusual features.
Melanocytic Nevus,Melanocytic Nevus,CAA69E,"A melanocytic nevus, commonly known as a mole, is a benign growth of melanocytes, the pigment-producing cells in the skin. These lesions are typically brown or black and can be flat or raised. Most are harmless but require monitoring for changes.","Melanocytic nevi result mainly from genetic factors that influence melanocyte behavior. Ultraviolet (UV) exposure, particularly during childhood and adolescence, may stimulate the development of new moles or changes in existing ones.","Common in children, adolescents, and young adults. People with fair skin and a genetic predisposition tend to have a higher number of nevi, which may change over time, especially with sun exposure.","Regular skin checks, dermoscopy to evaluate color and border, and biopsy if significant changes in size, shape, or color occur."
Melanoma,Melanoma,BB9984,"Melanoma is a malignant skin cancer that develops from melanocytes, the cells responsible for skin pigmentation. It is highly aggressive and can metastasize to the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, and brain if not detected early.","Melanoma primarily arises from DNA mutations caused by intense intermittent UV exposure, especially sunburns in early life. Additional risk factors include family history, numerous or atypical moles, and genetic predisposition involving specific mutations.","Affects all age groups but is most common in middle-aged and older adults. Individuals with fair skin, light hair, multiple moles, or a family history of melanoma are at greater risk, particularly those exposed to intense sun.","Dermoscopy, skin biopsy, sentinel lymph node biopsy, and imaging tests like CT, MRI, or PET scan to assess spread and staging."
Squamous Cell Carcinoma,Squamous Cell Carcinoma,A27967,"Squamous cell carcinoma is a common skin cancer that arises from the squamous cells of the epidermis. It often appears as a red, scaly patch, open sore, or elevated growth. Without treatment, it can invade deeper tissues and metastasize.","Squamous cell carcinoma results from cumulative UV radiation exposure damaging the DNA of squamous cells. Risk factors also include chronic wounds, chemical carcinogens, immunosuppression, and exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV).","Primarily affects older adults with fair skin who have accumulated years of sun exposure. Outdoor workers, immunosuppressed individuals, and people with precancerous lesions like actinic keratoses are at elevated risk.","Skin examination, dermoscopy, and biopsy for confirmation. Imaging may be considered if deeper tissue involvement is suspected."
Vascular Lesion,Vascular Lesion,B37759,A vascular lesion is an abnormal growth or formation of blood vessels in the skin or underlying tissues. Examples include hemangiomas and port-wine stains. These lesions can be congenital or acquired and vary in severity and appearance.,"Vascular lesions arise from congenital abnormalities in blood vessel development or acquired trauma later in life. Hormonal changes, genetic mutations, and injuries can all contribute to the abnormal proliferation of blood vessels.","Hemangiomas typically appear in infants within the first few weeks of life. Other vascular malformations can be present at birth or develop later in life, affecting people of all skin types and ages.","Clinical evaluation and visual assessment. In some cases, ultrasound or MRI may be used to assess depth or vascular involvement."
